Oreburgh Mining Museum "Coal Mining and You!"
These vents exchange the hot air down below with the fresh air outside.
Looking down them gives me the urge to start yelling into 'em!
Oreburgh Pokemon Gym.      Leader: Roark
"Call me Roark the Rock!"
The gym leader is young, but he's the mine's safety supervisor.
He's an expert in more than just one field!
Have you seen the vents?   They release steam from down below.
Up ahead there's a huge mountain that towers above everything.
It devided Sinnoh into two distinct halves.
Everyone's proud of the mine.
They're digging for coal under the sea as we speak...
It's amazing how they do it!
Chop, chop, MACHOP!        Chop, Chop away on rocks!
Feeling hale and hearty puts a smile on my face. And that makes me happy.
This pile of dirty sand is called a slag heap.
It's the waste from sorting coal.
Oreburgh Coal Mine         Beware of Bussy Pokemon!
