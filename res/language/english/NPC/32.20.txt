Lilycove - Pearl of the world
Lilycove City - Where the land ends and the sea begins.
I'm looking forward to visiting the Artist Gallery!
I came from Kanto. But the Hoenn region is so beautiful
with its land and fresh water
There is a strange cove at the edge of town?
My missing Pokemon it came back without me noticing!

I heard there's a tower somewhere out on a route. 
It's called Sky Pillar, I hear.
