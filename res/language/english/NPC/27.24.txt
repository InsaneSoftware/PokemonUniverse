Slateport harbor
Slateport city. The port where people and Pokemon cross paths. 
My family runs a candy factory. I am here to sell some.
we are closed. 
I sell stuff. you want some?
Whew... I'm just bushed...
I hiked over from mauville city. But boy this city is huge.
If I had know I would have ridden my bike here. 
If you put dolls or cushions on the floor, they'll become dirty. 
I'm going to buy some bricks so my dolls and cushions won't get dirty. 
Whenever I come here, I get carried away and buy to much. 
The light of the light house reaches dozens of miles away. 
I wonder if it doesn't startle Pokemon in the sea. 
Do you know what they do with ships that become to creaky to sail?
They sink them in the sea to become habitats for Pokemon.
The sea is just so vast...
Could the sea have been made by the tears shed by Pokemon?
