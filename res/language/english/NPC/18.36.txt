I'll check how well you've raised your POKÈMON.
Ba-ba-battle 
Hubba hubba battle 
How are you enjoying MT. BATTLE?
Listen up, young fellow! POKeMON battling is about...
One, guts. Two, guts. Three and four, guts. And five, guts!
Your complexion's not good.You should work out with me and shed a little sweat!
I'm very good at this. Big guy, please don't cry when you lose.
No light will illuminate your path!
I have never lifted anything heavier than a POKe BALL. 
Oh, what a darling boy! I will teach you in a way even you will understand!
AREA 5,the last in MT. BATTLE's first half, ends here.The closer is me, ZENTIN.
