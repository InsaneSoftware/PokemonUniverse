Amity Square East Gate          Closed for the season
I would like to live in Hearthome when I get maried.
But my boyfriend wants to live in Veilstone 'cause of its Game Corner...
They call me Mr. Goods.
No one knows my real name. No, not even I do...
I dedicate my self to seeking rarities. It's what I live for.
...
I'll find something rare for you, so talk to me some other time.
I get to see Pokemon all day long,  but there sure are many kinds.
How many are there now?
When I take my baby out in his stroller, I see the town in a different way.
I notice things like stairs and bumps in the sidewalk.
I'm visting here all the way from the Hoenn region.
I had been hoping to enter in a contest, but they are closed.
I'll be waiting for it to open again.

I can feel the baby stroller becoming heavier every day.
I wonder what kind of Pokemon my child will become friends with first?
