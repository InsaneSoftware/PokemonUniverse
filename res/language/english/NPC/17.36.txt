It's AREA 4 from here.Would you like to battle with me,sweetie?Here I come!
I'm a graduate of PHENAC CITY's PRE GYM.My grades were blemish-free!
Hm!I sense formidable power in you!
Battling a wee lad would make for a nice change of pace.
Oh, now what have we here? Challenger, you're looking mighty peppy!
I have lots of money, so I can buy all the items I want!
Even more than eating or napping,I love POKeMON!
I became a trainer when I was about your age, I'd say.
In our battle, I'll show you everything that I've ever learned.
Anchoring AREA 4 is me, TRINCH! Go, go, go!
