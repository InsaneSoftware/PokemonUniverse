Floaroma Town          Vivid & Scented
Welcome to Floaroma, the town of flowers, flowers and more flowers!
You should plant some flowers of your own. Yay for flowers!
Being surrounded by flowers puts me in an oddly pleasant mood.
I got drawn here by the sweet scent of Honey...
Seriously, what's that? What am I? A pokemon or something? Mmm ... Honey.
I simply love it here... The atmosphere is so uplifting.
You came to get emotionally healed too, didn't you?
Pick a Peck of Colors Flower Shop
The berries you pick can be used as food for pokemon.
