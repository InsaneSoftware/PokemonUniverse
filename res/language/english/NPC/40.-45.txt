Celestic Town          The Past Lives
Hey, do you know what they say?
They say a Pokemon created the Sinnoh region.
There is no Pokemarkt in this town so I go to Eterna City to shop.
Howdy!                 Studying up on local history?
A giant etching of a Pokemon like creature covers the wall...
There is some fading text etched in as well...
Space is ever-expanding dimensions... Our spirits, too are as space...
The flow of time never stops...       The past, future, and present...
