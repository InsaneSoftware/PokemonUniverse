Solaceon Town              Free of Worry!
I'm too little, so I don't know how to battle very good.
The nice Day-Care Lady is teaching me how to raise my Pokemon.
You have your history, and every Pokemon has their own history.
When the two collide new drama is born.
Every Sunday I visit the Lost Tower.
Breathing in this refreshing air...
It even perks up Pokemon! That's why I'm out here.
Howdy, traveling Trainer. Take it easy, slow, and casual.
There used to be nothing here but a road that went straight through.
Over time, Pokemon and people just gathered, and the town came to be.
