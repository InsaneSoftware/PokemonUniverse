Pastoria City                 The Marsh City
Pastoria Great Marsh          Observatory Gate
Pastoria City Pokemon Gym     Leader: Crasher Wake
The torrential Masked Master!
I'm visting the arena because I wanted to see the Great Marsh.
I'm staying at the lakeside hotel.
Wasn't the Pastoria Gym Leader kind of breathtaking in a weird way?
But don't judge him by the way he looks and acts.
I hear he uses the prize money to help people and Pokemon in trouble.
Here where I am standing, I'm smack-dab in the middle of town.
I study rare pokemon that only appear in the marsh.
