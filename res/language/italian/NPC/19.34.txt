Are you prepared to lose? AREA 8 starts with me. Here we come!
Whenever and wherever it may be, I battle as if it were my last.
Guy, are you okay? It's okay if you want to give up.
I might not look it,but I'm one for gaining real experience in battle.
I toughened up my party through field-work.
My POKeMON and I have ample base stamina.We won't lose if we get into an extended battle.
I constantly run simulations of POKeMON battles. I'll be perfect in a real battle!
Trainers who love their POKeMON should pump up their physiques, too.
Awesome, that's you! It's an accomplishment just getting here.
Hello, sweetie pie! You look just like my grandson, you cute little boy.
Hmm. You have a unique air about you that sets you apart from the challengers I've seen.
But, who cares? First, we battle!
