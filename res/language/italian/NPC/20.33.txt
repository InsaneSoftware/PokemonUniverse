Well, well, well! You have finally marched your way up to AREA 10.
I, TANDO, shall meet your challenge!
Fwofwofwo. Young one, it's good to see you've climbed this far.
But your climb stops here!
You're going to knock me out? That's impossible!
Oh, I think it's stupendous that you've come so far.
But that doesn't mean I will ease up on you!
You're now halfway through AREA 10.Getting complacent now can ruin you!
You came all the way here?Excellent,excellent! I'm getting fired up!
You're awfully unlucky.I mean, you just had to run into me with only four ZONES to go.
There are just three to go including me.Will you fall here or advance?En garde!
Oh, my, my, my! You've won your way up through the ranks to be here!
You're more excellent than my pupils! Now, show me an excellent battle!
